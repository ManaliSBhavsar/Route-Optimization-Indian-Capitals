# Python program to compute the shortest path between Indian state capitals
Uses Single Source Shortest Path (SSSP) Algorithm. Fetched distance data from Google Maps, structured it into a DataFrame, and implemented algorithms like Dijkstra’s to optimize travel routes efficiently.

Tech Stack:
Python (for implementing the algorithm and the overall logic)
Google Maps API (for fetching distance data)
Google Maps Python Client (for interacting with the API)
Dijkstra’s Algorithm (for shortest path calculation)
Data Structures (using arrays for graph representation and shortest path calculation)
